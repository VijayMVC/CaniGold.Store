/*
	This query provides the core of the filtering, paging, and sorting used by
	the FilteredListing. All of the work is performed on the SQL server; only
	the final filtered, paged, and sorted results are returned from this query.

	This query is designed to wrap an arbitrary SQL query that contains a
	[Paging.RowIndex] column. That query is injected at the "{{0}}" token in this
	file.

	Sorting is performed by the Paging.RowIndex column in the injected query.
	See the RowSortTemplate.sql file for the column syntax.

	Filtering is performed by the where clause of the injected query combined
	with any provded SQL parameters.
	
	The bulk of this query is for supporting paging. It breaks up the requested
	row range (indicated by @_startingRowIndex and @_pageSize) into pages 
	correctly aligned on page boundaries calculated from the first row of data.
	It ensure that when requesting a page beyond those available, only the last
	page of data is retured, starting at the page boundary.
